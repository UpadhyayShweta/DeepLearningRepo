## Intel Image Classification using **CNN with **Keras

In this notebook, we'll be attempting to classify images of Natural Scenes around the world by using transfer learning from a pre-trained network(VGG16).
For building this classification model dataset used will be Intel Image Classification dataset from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification?resource=download)
